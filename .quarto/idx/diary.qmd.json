The data set collected from analyzing public transport usage, commuter flows, and travel patterns could allow for better planning and possibly the implementation of a hub and spoke model, similar to what is utilized by airports but at a smaller scale for public transport in Singapore (TransVirtual, 2022). The hub and spoke model is a distribution network with a central hub that allows spokes to meet at a central location, and is commonly used in transportation networks.*\n\n-   **(3) Which rows and columns of the dataset will be used to answer this question? (Answer: Actual names of the variables in the dataset that you plan to use)**\n\n    *The columns of the data set used in this will be the name of the stations listed under the column:* **PT_CODE***, the other 2 columns of raw data to be analysed will be* **TOTAL_TAP_IN_VOLUME** *and* **TOTAL_TAP_OUT_VOLUME***.*\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Week 8\n\n-   **(1) What is the topic that you have finalized?
